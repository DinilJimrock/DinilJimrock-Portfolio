## Projects üöÄ

- **[E-Commerce Microservices Architecture](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/Jwt-Authentication-Token-Verification)**  
  I developed a scalable E-Commerce application using a microservices architecture with services like Product Service and Order Service, ensuring modularity and fault tolerance. Even if a specific service, such as the Order Service, encounters a failure, other services continue functioning seamlessly. Data for each service is securely stored in a MySQL database. Additionally, the services are registered and managed using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka for dynamic service discovery and load balancing. This project showcases the implementation of a resilient and maintainable microservices-based architecture for modern web applications.

- **[User Authentication](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/Jwt-Authentication-Token-Verification)**  
  I developed a JWT Authentication project using Java and Spring Boot. The project handles user authentication and authorization by generating tokens during sign-up and login processes. These tokens are validated to control access permissions, while user data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.

- **[Boooking System](//https://github.com/DinilJimrock/Booking-Application)**  
  The Booking System project features a robust backend developed using Java, Spring, and REST APIs, ensuring seamless functionality. For data management, I utilized MySQL to handle all database operations efficiently.

- **[Parking Lot API](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/ParkingLot-API)**  
  A scalable parking lot management system using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

 - **[Tic Tac Toe Backend](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/TicTacToe-Backend)**  
  Built with Java and RESTful API, implemented low-level design patterns like Builder and Strategy.

 - **[Delivery - Website](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/Delivery-website)**  
  The Delivery Website is a dynamic frontend application built solely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, providing an intuitive user experience for online ordering.

 - **[Tin-Dog](https://github.com/DinilJimrock/TinDog-WebApp)**  
  The Tin Dog Website is a frontend project created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, designed to facilitate dog selling through an engaging web interface.
